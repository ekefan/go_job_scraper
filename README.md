## Job Panda: a telegram bot that scrapes webpages for job postings

I picked interest in Golang recently, and unlike other programming languages from the past
this is different, because I will be  away from school for at least 5 months and I'd love to
make international progress with programming. I have neither bought a course nor am I following 
any youtube full tutorial, I got started with a tour of Go and followed some instructions on the 
official Go documentation.

**Job panda** is my first project and I will love see it completed :).

## readme update.
The Bot employes a webscraping script to fetch job postings from jooble.com when /getme command is used.

How did I connect my local host to the public internet?
Ngok (a service that makes my localhost publicly available to the internet) was used to make my local host server public.
Then created a webhook endpoint to receive post requests for the bot from telegram by:

```
curl -F "url=<ngroks_url>/webhook" https://api.telegram.org/bot<bot_token>/setWebhook
```

The main entry of the program runs the bot's http handler
```
package main

import "github.com/ekefan/go_job_scraper/handler"

func main() {
	
	handler.RunBotServer()

}
```
The function loads environment variables in the dotenv file, then listens of port:3000 to serve the HandlerFunction.
- The handler picks up a http resquest called an update
- Parses the update to convert it into a struct called Update; Update is designed to look like the json data in the 
update request.
- Based on the update message, a http response is generated and sent.
- if the update message starts with the command /getme, the bot scrapes the web for the description
following the command, like /getme backend developer jobs
- Other commands the bot recognizes are /help and /start and basic string responses are sent 

## After all
Building the project has help me gain a clearer understanding of golang's syntax and a http server client
