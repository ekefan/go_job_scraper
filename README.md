## A mini practice Project: Go web scraper

I picked up Go barely a month ago, and unlike other programming languages from the past<br>
this is different, because I will be  away from school for at least 5 months and I'd love to make international<br>
progress with programming. I neither bought any course nor follow any youtube tutorial, I got started with<br>
a tour of Go and followed some instructions on the official Go documentation.

This web scrapper is my first project and I will love see it completed :).
